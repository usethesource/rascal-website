#### Synopsis

Checks the type rules for a source language.

#### Description

A [type system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) is a set of rules that defines how values,
variables and functions may be used in a given programming languages.

A type checker, checks that these rules are enforced. The moment that type checking can be done differs
per type system, but two extremes exist:

*  _Static type checking_: all checking is done before the program is executed.
*  _Dynamic type checking_: all checking is done during execution of the program.
*  _Hybrid type checking_: when possible checks are done before execution, the remaining checks are done during execution. 


These different styles of type checking have different trade offs:

*  Static typechecking:
**  Pro: most errors are found before execution.
**  Con: more type declarations have to be written by the programmer and in some situations the type systems limits what can be expressed.
*  Dynamic checking:
**  Pro: most flexible and expressive.
**  Con: errors can only be found during execution.
*  Hybrid (or gradual) type checking:
**  Pro: a reasonable compromise.
**  Con not be as safe as full static typechecking.



#### Examples

*  In Java: If a variable has been declared as `bool` it cannot be added to an integer.
*  In Java: If a method has three formal parameters, it cannot be called with four actual parameters.
*  In Python: A variable can first get a string value assigned and later on an integer value.
