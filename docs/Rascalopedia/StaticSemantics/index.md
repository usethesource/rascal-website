title: Static Semantics
---

#### Synopsis

Description of the properties of a program that can be determined/checked before it is executed.

#### Description

The static semantics of a program describe all properties that can be determined before the program is executed.
A [Typechecker](../../Rascalopedia/Typechecker/index.md) is a tool that checks the properties of a program as described by its static semantics.

Static semantics describe properties that are relevant before a program is executed and 
differ from [Dynamic Semantics](../../Rascalopedia/DynamicSemantics/index.md) that
describe the execution behaviour itself.

#### Examples

Examples of static semantic properties include:

*  The proper use of types.
*  The proper use of names.


Language with substantial static semantics: Java, Haskell, Rascal.
Languages with only dynamic semantics: Python, Ruby.
