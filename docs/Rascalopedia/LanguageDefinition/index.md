#### Synopsis

Description of all aspects of a language.

#### Description

A language definition defines all relevant aspects of a programming language or [Domain Specific Language](../../Rascalopedia/DomainSpecificLanguage/index.md) and includes:

*  A [Grammar](../../Rascalopedia/Grammar/index.md) (including lexical and context-free syntax).
*  Rules to describe the textual formatting of a language. 
  These rules are sufficient to generate a [Prettyprinter](../../Rascalopedia/Prettyprinter/index.md) for it.
*  Rules that describe the [Static Semantics](../../Rascalopedia/StaticSemantics/index.md) of a language.
  These rules are sufficient to generate a [Typechecker](../../Rascalopedia/Typechecker/index.md).
*  Rules that describe the [Dynamic Semantics](../../Rascalopedia/DynamicSemantics/index.md) of a language. 
  These rules are sufficient to generate an [./Interpreter](../../Rascalopedia/Interpreter/index.md) for it.
*  Rules that describe how to generate code.


Other aspects of a language definition may include editor behaviour, highlighting, debugging, outlining, auto-completion and more.
