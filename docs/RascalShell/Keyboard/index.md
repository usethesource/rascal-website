#### Synopsis

Keybord shortcuts.

#### Description

When handling console input, RascalShell supports a subset of the shortcuts provided by
[GNU readline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline)

Some convenient shortcuts are:


| `Ctrl+a`  | Move cursor to begin of line. |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+d`  | EOF marker, closes the current RascalShell (equivalent to the |
|           | command (`quit`). |
| `Ctrl+e`  | Move cursor to end of line. |
| `Ctrl+k`  | Kill remainder of line after cursor. |
| `Ctrl+l`  | Clear screen. |

#### Benefits

* [RascalShell](../../RascalShell/index.md) is built on top of [JLine](https://github.com/jline)
