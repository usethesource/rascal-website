title: Word Replacement
---

#### Synopsis

Replace words in a string.

#### Description

Suppose you are a book editor and want to ensure that all chapter
and section titles are properly capitalized. Here is how to do this. 

#### Examples


```rascal 

module demo::common::WordReplacement

import String;


str capitalize(str word:/^<letter:[a-z]><rest:.*>/) 
  = "<toUpperCase(letter)><rest>";

default str capitalize(str word) = word;
test bool capitalize2() = capitalize("rascal") == "Rascal";


str capAll1(str S)      ❷  
{
 result = "";
 while (/^<before:\W*><word:\w+><after:.*$>/ := S) { 
    result = result + before + capitalize(word);
    S = after;
  }
  return result;
}

test bool tstCapAll1() =  capAll1("turn this into a title") == "Turn This Into A Title";


str capAll2(str S)      ❸  
{
   return visit(S){
   	case /^<word:\w+>/i => capitalize(word)
   };
}


test bool tstCapAll2() = capAll2("turn this into a title") == "Turn This Into A Title";

```

                
* ❶  We start by introducing a helper function `capitalize` that does the actual capitalization of a single word.
    See [Regular Pattern](../../../Rascal/Patterns/Regular/index.md) for details about regular expression patterns.
    Next we give two versions of a capitalization function for a sentence:

* ❷  `capAll1` uses a while loop to find subsequent words and to replace them by a capitalized version.
* ❸  `capAll2` uses a [Visit](../../../Rascal/Statements/Visit/index.md) to visit all words in the sentence and replace them by a capitalized version.


Here are some examples:


```rascal-shell 
rascal>import demo::common::WordReplacement;
ok
rascal>capitalize("rascal");
str: "Rascal"
rascal>capAll1("turn this into a capitalized title")
str: "Turn This Into A Capitalized Title"
rascal>capAll2("turn this into a capitalized title")
str: "Turn This Into A Capitalized Title"
```
