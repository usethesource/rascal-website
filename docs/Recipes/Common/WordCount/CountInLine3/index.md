title: CountInLine3
---

#### Synopsis

Count words in a line.

#### Examples

Here is a clever, albeit rather dense, solution that illustrates several Rascal concepts.

```rascal 

module demo::common::WordCount::CountInLine3




int countInLine3(str s) {
  return (0 | it + 1 | /\w+/ := s);
}
test bool tstCountInLine3b() = countInLine3("Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll") == 4;

```

                
We use a [reducer](../../../../Rascal/Expressions/Reducer/index.md) that is a recipe to reduce the values produced by one or more generators
  to a single value:
  
* `0` is the initial value of the reducer
*  The pattern match `/\w+/ := S` matches all words in `S`.
*  Reduction is done by `it + 1`. In the latter `it` is a keyword that refers to the
   value that has been reduced so far. Effectively, the matches are reduced to a match count.


Let's try it:

```rascal-shell 
rascal>import demo::common::WordCount::CountInLine3;
ok
rascal>countInLine3("Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll");
int: 4
```
