## Developers
### Library contributions

The Rascal team is currently quite small. In this stage it is good to be small.
However, we do solicit for Rascal library contributions. Examples are bindings
for version repository systems and bug databases, or front-ends for programming
   languages and domain specific languages. Please contact us if you are
   interested.

### Enhancements, bugs and patches

We welcome feedback. Please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal/issues) 
to submit your contributions. Thanks! Champion bug reporters will be awarded with Rascal T-shirts.

### Source access

Rascal is completely hosted on GitHub, [under the cwi-swat repositories](https://github.com/organizations/cwi-swat).
See our [developer setup](https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal/wiki/Rascal-Developers-Setup---Step-by-Step)
instructions on which projects to checkout and dependencies to install.
