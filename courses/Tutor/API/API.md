#### Synopsis

The Tutor compiler reads Rascal source files and produces ((Concept)) markdown files 
for each Rascal module.

#### Description

The compiler generates for every `Module.rsc` a markdown file with the following structure:

``````
---
title: <moduleName>
---

// for each declaration (function, data, syntax, alias, import, extend)
## <declarationName> {#fully-qualified-declaration-name}

#### Synopsis

...
#### Description
...

// etc.
``````

So, for all standard ((Concept)) headers, like `Synopsis` and `Benefits` there is a place at every declaration.

The content of the header paragraphs is either directly derived from source code (like function signature and data definitions), or it is taken from the following tag definitions on each declaration:
* `@doc` may contain literally the headers of a ((Concept)), like `#### Synopsis`. This notation is deprecated in favor of the tags below.
* `@synopsis` is a single line description of the definition.
* `@description` is a multi-line explanantion of the definition.
* `@benefits`, `@pitfalls`, `@examples`, `@types`, `@name` and `@function` each follow the intent of the standard ((Concept)) headers.

The documentation written for features without an explicit synopsis is not rendered. In other words it is obligatory to use at least a `@synopsis` tag or start with a `#### Synopsis` header..

#### Benefits

* A (small) part of documentation writing is automated. The information about the name of a function, data or annotation declaration, or its signature is always consistent.
* You can write examples of the usage of each definition using ((Listing)) markup that is run and checked at documentation compile-time.

#### Pitfalls 

* This approach requires that functions with the same name are grouped together in the source file. 
* You need to run the tutor compiler before errors in the documentation tags are detected.
