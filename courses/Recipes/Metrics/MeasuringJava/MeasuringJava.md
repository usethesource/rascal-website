#### Description


This is a recipe for computing basic or more advanced metrics from a Java project in Eclipse. We assume:

* You have Rascal installed in an Eclipse instance.
* You have a Java project in your Eclipse workspace that compiles without errors. Let's call it `HelloWorld`.


Now we will follow the [EASY]((EASY)) paradigm:

* A library will be used to _parse_ the Java code generating ((Rascalopedia:AbstractSyntaxTree))
* The same library will generate a ((Rascal:Values/Relation))al model to represent interesting facts between Java source code artifacts
* Then we can write queries over the generated trees and relations using ((Rascal:Expressions)).


These are a number of recipes for measuring different things about Java:

* ((MeasuringClasses))
* ((MeasuringMethods))

#### Examples


First we import the basic data types for representing Java. The model is called _M3_, and its definition is split acros a generic
language independent module called ((Library:module:analysis::m3::Core)) and a Java specific part called ((Library:module:lang::java::m3::AST)). Have a look at the documentation 
of these modules later. For now we will go through using them in a few examples.

```rascal-prepare
import IO;
if ({l} := findResources("Metrics/MeasuringJava/snakes-and-ladders-project-source.zip")) {
   copy(l[scheme="zip+<l.scheme>"][path="<l.path>!/"], |tmp:///snakes-and-ladders|, recursive=true);
} else {
   throw "failed to copy necessary source code to analyze for this example";
}
```

```rascal-shell
import lang::java::m3::Core;
import lang::java::m3::AST;
```

"Snakes and Ladders" is an example Java project of which we have stored the source code in `|tmp:///snakes-and-ladders/src|`
```rascal-shell,continue
|tmp:///snakes-and-ladders/src/snakes/|.ls
```

Now we can extract our overview model:
```rascal-shell,continue
myModel = createM3FromDirectory(|tmp:///snakes-and-ladders/src|);
```

Some projects have extensive classpaths which the M3 extractor requires for accurate Java analysis.
You can use this code to extract a classpath if the project is a Maven project:

```rascal-shell,continue
import util::Reflective;
cp = getProjectPathConfig(|tmp:///snakes-and-ladders|).libs;
```

and then pass it into the M3 extractor (this project does not have dependencies)
```rascal-shell,continue
myModel = createM3FromDirectory(|tmp:///snakes-and-ladders/src|, classPath=cp);
```

#### Benefits

*  Notice that _all_ these ((Rascal:Values-Location)) literals are hyperlinks and you can click on them to go the source code that they point to. Try it!
* M3 models are great for metrics, but also they are the basis for many other static analyses
* See ((MeasuringClasses)) and ((MeasuringMethods)) for more benefits
